### 15. Findings
#### 15.1 Provision of stored blood
The supply of blood for 3 amputation-dependent patients was associated with very high risk. The new procedure of sending blood samples to Mbeya via the Regional Hospital and having the blood samples screened there was both time-consuming and life-threatening in terms of the amputation to be performed. Only with massive pressure was it possible to provide 3 blood stores for one patient. The patient was already in a coma. Only at the last moment could the patient be rescued.

Recommendation for further missions is to have a minimum stock of 2 blood samples screened immediately before a mission for each blood group immediately before the start of the mission. Atiman Hospital. In addition, it is recommended that you obtain a suitable refrigerator with an interruptible power supply.

#### 15.2 Contribution of the diocese and the Rukwa region to the deployment costs
In the past, it was regulated that at the invitation already a participation of the diocese and the district government were excluded. They have been confident that our teams will pay for all the food and lodging costs. This also included the catering of the regular staff (20 persons) of Dr. Atiman Memorial Hospital.

Recommendation for further missions is that the diocese and the Rukwa region at least take over the food for the participants and the provision of food (3 sacks of cornmeal, 3 sacks of beans, 3 sacks of rice and 50 bottles of oil).

#### 15.3 Perception of the task force and the regular staff of Dr. Ing. Atiman Hospitals
It was the first time in the 10-year history of the project that it meant that neither a diocese representative nor a representative of the Rukwa region were present to welcome the team. In addition, no welcome message was sent in writing. This was considered disrespectful by all parties involved in both the task force and the hospital. In addition, the press had been able to report about 24 prostheses, for which the signatory had assumed full financial responsibility. After all, this is a new service, with the Dr. Atiman Hospital gets a unique selling proposition for the region. Mother Sr. Yasinta apologized for that at the end.

Fr. John only spoke on demand on the last day and informed that he was on vacation. This was also rated negative. In addition, he was not even in the hospital in the previous missions as the coordinator responsible.

Recommendation for further missions is that the work of the intervention teams and the regular staff of Dr. Atiman Hospitals e.g. appropriately praised during morning praying or a farewell evening.
